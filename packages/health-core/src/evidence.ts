    reason: 'The USPSTF recommends annual low-dose CT screening for adults aged 50–80 with a smoking history of ≥15 pack-years (current or former smokers). Low-dose CT can detect lung cancer at an early, treatable stage, significantly reducing lung cancer mortality.',

The effect appears strongest for EPA-rich formulations.\n\nOmega-3 also plays an important role in cognitive protection. Randomised trials found that B vitamin supplementation slowed brain atrophy by 40% — but only in participants with adequate omega-3 levels. When omega-3 was low, B vitamins had no effect.
